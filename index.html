    Use only pure ExtJS MVC Application > 4.2 version (no jQuery etc.).
        1. Fetch the data from data.json file and display 4 columns (name, age, gender, email) in extjs grid panel
        2. Use Inline cell editing feature, try to add a new record, editing a cell, bulk saving ( Returning same data.json file is enough even after updating/adding. )
        3. Validation needs to be done in client side. ( Ex: name as required field, email for mail field validation, age field must be a positive integer )
    !!! QUALITY OF THE CODE IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN COMPLETION OF THE TASK!!!!
